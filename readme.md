## Project Description

This project is a Sudoku visualizer that allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles interactively. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their own Sudoku puzzles or choose from a set of pre-defined puzzles. The visualizer then uses an algorithm to solve the puzzle step by step, highlighting the cells and numbers being filled in. Users can also pause, resume, and reset the solving process at any time.

## Algorithm Used

The Sudoku solving algorithm used in this project is a backtracking algorithm. It starts by finding an empty cell in the puzzle and tries different numbers from 1 to 9 to fill in that cell. If a number is found to be valid, it moves on to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If a number is found to be invalid, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. This process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.
